"The cow jumps over the moon. The dog jumps over the moon” . NGramCounter is an API endpoint that generates n-grams and frequency counts of the n-grams based on the provided text. The n-grams and its frequency are returned in descending order of frequency. For example if your text is “The cow jumps over the moon. The dog jumps over the moon”  and you needed bi-gram counts, the output would be as follows:The first two parameters are mandatory and the third parameter is optional. For the first parameter, text – the text that you provide can be any type of text ranging from news articles, to Tweets to customer support emails in any language. Please only provide plain text. The second parameter, n-gram would be a number ranging from

1-10. Use 1 if you want to generate counts of words. Use 2 or more for the preferred type of n-gram. The third parameter essentially specifies if you should distinguish the different capitalization used in text. For example, if you set the case-sensitive parameter to true the word “Love” and “love” would be regarded as two different words. If you see no use case for this, please ignore this parameter as by default, all words are lowercased.Here is an example of NGramCounter parameters in Mashape for generating tri-grams for the text “I love rainy days. How I wish it was raining ! How I wish it was snowing !”
